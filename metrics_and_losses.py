    Hausdorff Distance.
    
    Computes the (symmetric) Hausdorff Distance (HD) between the binary objects in two
    images. It is defined as the maximum surface distance between the objects.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    result : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    reference : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    voxelspacing : float or sequence of floats, optional
        The voxelspacing in a distance unit i.e. spacing of elements
        along each dimension. If a sequence, must be of length equal to
        the input rank; if a single number, this is used for all axes. If
        not specified, a grid spacing of unity is implied.
    connectivity : int
        The neighbourhood/connectivity considered when determining the surface
        of the binary objects. This value is passed to
        `scipy.ndimage.generate_binary_structure` and should usually be :math:`> 1`.
        Note that the connectivity influences the result in the case of the Hausdorff distance.
        
    Returns
    -------
    hd : float
        The symmetric Hausdorff Distance between the object(s) in ```result``` and the
        object(s) in ```reference```. The distance unit is the same as for the spacing of 
        elements along each dimension, which is usually given in mm.

    This is a real metric. The binary images can therefore be supplied in any order.

    Average symmetric surface distance.
    
    Computes the average symmetric surface distance (ASD) between the binary objects in

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.

        of the binary objects. This value is passed to
        `scipy.ndimage.generate_binary_structure` and should usually be :math:`> 1`.
        The decision on the connectivity is important, as it can influence the results
        strongly. If in doubt, leave it as it is.
